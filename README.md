# ct-net-modeling

COMING SOON: This repository will contain the code for the CT volume
machine learning models described in:

Draelos et al. Machine-Learning-Based Multiple Abnormality Prediction with
Large-Scale Chest Computed Tomography Volumes.
https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.04752.pdf
Accepted for publication in Medical Image Analysis (2020).

## Usage

These models can be run using the Singularity container defined here:
